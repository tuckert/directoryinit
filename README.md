# Directory Invitation Tool

### The problem
When installing a new access control system in a subdivision, apartment complex, or other housing complex, the need arises to get updated contact information from residents before deployment of the system.  
### The solution
This tool is for an installer or manager or a new system to send text or email messages with a verification link.  Tenants use the link to submit their name and telephone numbers (some systems can call more than one).  When it is time to deploy, the information can be downlaoded by the installer/manager and used as the initial database of names and numbers when setting up the controller.  Afterwards, the system can still run, sending invitations to new tenants, and resending invitations to current tenants to change their data.  Notifications can be sent to managers when data has been updated.  Invitations can have a life span and max usage.
### Requirements
Email setup is currently done through gmail.  Twilio is also used for sending text messages.
#### The fine print
This project is uncompleted and not fit for deployment at this time.  As with most of my projects, I have a bad habit of getting sidetracked and working on something else.
